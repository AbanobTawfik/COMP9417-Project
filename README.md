# COMP9417-Project
This repo contains Python scripts for testing common supervised learning techniques on the Kaggle Otto Group dataset, which is contained under the 'Data' directory in csv format. The output data generated by each method is also present in csv format.

The following methods are tested:
* Logistic Regression (under the name baseline.py)
* K-Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Trees
* Naive Bayes

# Running The Code
we are assuming you are running the code using python 3.6.9 (64-bit) and have the following packages installed
* pip install numpy
* pip install pandas
* pip install scikit-learn

to run a specific model, go to the specific folder and run the python file. This will 
1. output the accuracy of the model using a simple test_validation_split with 80% of the data
2. output the accuracy of the model using K-Fold-Cross Validation with 5 folds
3. create a folder named results which will output a csv file containing the results and probability of each class output for the model

# Data
* The training data is located in the Data folder under "training.csv" it contains 61,878 rows of data and 93 features and 1 target class
* The test data is located in the Data folder under "test.csv" it contains 144,368 rows of data and 93 features

Due to the large Number of features we had also included code to select top k features in a function called get_top_featuresk located in 'naive bayes'.py and KNN.py.
